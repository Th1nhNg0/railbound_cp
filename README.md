# Railbound Constraint Programming Solver

![Railbound Cover](cover.jpg)

This project provides a robust solver for the delightful puzzle game [Railbound](https://afterburn.games/railbound/), built using the power of **Constraint Programming** with [MiniZinc](https://www.minizinc.org/). It can automatically find valid track layouts for even the most complex puzzles.

## About The Project

Railbound's gameplay, which involves laying a limited number of tracks to connect train cars to a locomotive, is a natural fit for a Constraint Satisfaction Problem (CSP). This solver models the game's rules, mechanics, and objectives as a set of mathematical constraints. A MiniZinc solver then explores the vast space of possible track layouts to find a working solution.

This repository is a comprehensive resource for anyone interested in constraint programming, puzzle solving, or the technical details of Railbound's mechanics.
